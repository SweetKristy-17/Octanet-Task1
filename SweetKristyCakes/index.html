                <p>Some nights the aroma of a baking cake would bring me back to consciousness. Leon would never wake me with the noise of a mixer, everything he did was with ninja stealth, all hand-mixed. It was how he relaxed; some folks soak in a lavender bath, others take a walk in nature or loose themselves in a book. Leon baked cakes. When his work stress was at his worst I was finding homes for cakes every morning. Each one of them was gratefully received and Leon was free to bake more the next evening.</p>
